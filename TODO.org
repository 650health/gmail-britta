* TODO Change the class structure for `Filter`: use a delegate
  The result of this should allow the filter definition's `self`'s
  class can be customized (for more targeted conditions and such).
* TODO Finalization model for single-filter definition
  Allow defining multible conditions, actions in the filter body. Then
  at the end of the block finalize into filter object & register that.
* TODO Check for maximum length of filter conditions
* TODO Avoid emitting empty filters if there is a .archive_unless_directed
* TODO Maybe a more convenient has/has_not criteria format?
  Something like this?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    has :to, 'gandals@flyingschool.com'
    has :from, 'fools@shire.com'
  #+END_SRC
  Might also make it easier to optimize filter expressions for length
  (but how to specify OR? Guess this is for a version 1.0/2.0)
